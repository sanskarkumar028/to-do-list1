## Funtioning of the code:

**- Imports and Setup:**
  - express, body-parser, mongoose, date, and _ are imported as required modules.
  - express is used to create the web application.
  - body-parser is used to parse the incoming request bodies.
  - mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
  - date.js (not provided) is likely a custom module for handling date-related operations.
  - _ is used from the lodash library for utility functions.
  - app is created as an instance of the Express application.
  - View engine is set to EJS.
  - Body parser and static file serving from the "public" directory are configured.
  - MongoDB connection is established.

**- Mongoose Schemas and Models:**
  - itemsSchema defines the schema for a single to-do list item.
  - Item model is created using the itemsSchema.
  - defaultItems array contains default items for a new list.
  - listSchema defines the schema for a to-do list.
  - List model is created using the listSchema.

**- Homepage Route ("/"):**

  - Finds existing to-do list items using Item.find().
  - If no items are found, inserts defaultItems into the database.
  - Renders the "list" view with the found items or the default items.

**- Custom List Route ("/:customListName"):**

  - Handles dynamic routes based on the list name in the URL.
  - Capitalizes the custom list name using _.capitalize().
  - Searches for a list with the provided name using List.findOne().
  - If no list is found, creates a new list with default items and redirects to the new list.
  - If a list is found, renders the "list" view with the list's items.

**- POST Route ("/" - Adding New Items):**

  - Handles the submission of a new to-do item.
  - Creates a new Item instance with the provided name.
  - If the list name is "Today", the item is saved to the database and the user is redirected to the homepage.
  - If the list name is a custom list, the item is added to the list and the user is redirected to the custom list.

**- POST Route ("/delete" - Deleting Items):**

- Handles the deletion of to-do items.
- If the list name is "Today", finds and removes the item by ID using Item.findByIdAndRemove().
- If the list name is a custom list, uses $pull to remove the item from the list using List.findOneAndUpdate().

**- About Route ("/about"):**

- Renders the "about" view.

**- Server Start:**

- Listens on port 3000 and starts the server.

**- list.ejs (EJS Template):**

- Displays the list title at the top of the page.
- Loops through newListItems to display each item.
- Each item is displayed along with a checkbox for marking completion.
- Items can be deleted using the delete form.
- New items can be added using the input form at the bottom.

**- style.css (CSS Stylesheet):**

- Defines the styling for the web application, including colors, fonts, and layout.


## Functioning of each and every Mongoose function implemented:

**- mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/todolistDB"):**

- This function establishes a connection to the MongoDB database named "todolistDB" running locally on the default port (27017).

**- const Item = mongoose.model("Item", itemsSchema);**

- This creates a Mongoose model named "Item" based on the itemsSchema.
- The model represents a collection in the database where each document follows the itemsSchema structure.

**- const List = mongoose.model("List", listSchema);**

- Similar to the previous step, this creates a Mongoose model named "List" based on the listSchema.

**- Item.find():**

- Retrieves all documents from the "Item" collection.
- Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of items.

**- Item.insertMany(defaultItems):**

- Inserts an array of documents (defaultItems) into the "Item" collection.
- Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of inserted items.

**- List.findOne({ name: customListName }):**

- Searches for a single document in the "List" collection that matches the provided customListName.
- Returns a Promise that resolves to the found document or null if not found.

**- list.save():**

- Saves a new document (list) to the "List" collection.

**- List.findOneAndUpdate({ name: listName }, { $pull: { items: { _id: checkedItemId } } }):**

- Finds a document in the "List" collection by its name and updates it using the $pull operator to remove an item from the items array.
- Returns a Promise that resolves to the updated document.

**- Item.findByIdAndRemove(checkedItemId):**

- Finds a document by its ID and removes it from the "Item" collection.
- Returns a Promise that resolves when the operation is complete.

**- foundList.items.push(item):**

- Adds a new item to the items array of a found list document.

**- foundList.save():**

- Saves the changes made to a list document, including the newly added item.

These Mongoose functions allow the application to perform various database operations, such as querying for documents, inserting new documents, updating existing documents, and removing documents. The usage of these functions helps in creating, updating, and managing the to-do items and lists in the application.
